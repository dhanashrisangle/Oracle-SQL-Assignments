## Oracle SQL Assignment: Sublanguage Commands, Operators, and Functions
### Introduction:
In this assignment, I have completed number of problems or tasks to demonstrate my understanding of Oracle SQL fundamentals. 
Each query or task addresses a specific aspect of SQL querying in an Oracle database environment.
This repository contains solutions for a basic Oracle SQL assignment covering sublanguage commands including Data Definition Language (DDL), 
Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Query Language (DQL)operations, various operators, and functions such as string functions, number functions, 
aggregation functions, date functions, and general functions.

## Introduction
This assignment aims to demonstrate proficiency in Oracle SQL by implementing and understanding various sublanguage commands, 
operators, and functions essential for database management and querying.

## DDL Commands
DDL (Data Definition Language) commands are used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects. In this section, 
DDL commands such as CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, etc., are demonstrated.

## DML Commands
DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are used to manipulate data within database objects. This section showcases commands 
like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc., for data manipulation.

## DQL Queries
DQL (Data Query Language) commands are used to retrieve data based on specified conditions. This section explores various queries 
using SELECT statements along with filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation operations.

# Operators

* Assignment Operators: Operators used for assignment purposes.
* Logical Operators: Operators used for logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, NOT).
* Arithmetic Operators: Operators used for arithmetic calculations (e.g., +, -, *, /).
* Relational Operators: Operators used for comparison operations (e.g., =, <, >, !=).
* Set Operators: Operators used for set operations (e.g., UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS).
* Special Operators: Operators with special functionalities (e.g., LIKE, IN, BETWEEN).

  
# Functions

* String Functions: Functions for string manipulation (e.g., CONCAT, SUBSTR, INSTR).
* Number Functions: Functions for numerical operations (e.g., ROUND, TRUNC, MOD).
* Aggregation Functions: Functions for performing calculations on groups of rows (e.g., AVG, SUM, COUNT).
* Date Functions: Functions for date and time manipulation (e.g., TO_DATE, MONTHS_BETWEEN, ADD_MONTHS).
* General Functions: Other miscellaneous functions (e.g., NVL, DECODE, CASE).
